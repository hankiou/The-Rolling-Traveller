# The-Rolling-Traveller
Alpha prototype of a 3D platformer made a long time ago, back to the days I was just starting to learn programming

The main purpose of this prototype was to train my UX Skills and set up a nice distant scoreboard system.
Gameplay is WAY improvable but hey you can open chests and loot skins !
